#### For Developer:


As the project is still in rapid itelating, we would like to suggest developers to build it their own version following the following steps:

1. git clone current project: `git clone https://github.com/DamonDeng/BRClient.git`
2. install yarn on your desktop
3. go to the project folder
4. run `yarn install` to install all the dependences of the project
5. run `yarn app:dev` to start a desktop app in developer mode.    or:   run `yarn dev` to start a local server and then access the app with browser.
6. Optional, if you want to run it as an app, run `yarn app:build` to build it, and the find the target file (we believe you can, :-)
